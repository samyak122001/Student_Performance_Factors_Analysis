# Student_Performance_Factors_Analysis

This project aims to analyze various factors that impact student performance, using a dataset containing features such as study hours, sleep duration, parental involvement, family income, and tutoring sessions. The project leverages data visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights about which factors most significantly affect student outcomes.

Key Findings:

Tutoring Sessions: Students attending one tutoring session tend to score higher in exams.

Study Hours: Male students who studied between 15-20 hours per week had higher performance.

Attendance: Students with higher attendance rates generally performed better.

Sleep Patterns: Students with regular sleep hours (6-8 hours) were more likely to score well.

Family Income & Parental Involvement: Medium-income families and students with moderate parental involvement saw better academic outcomes.

Extracurricular Activities: Participation in extracurriculars and access to internet resources correlated positively with performance.


Project Structure:


Data Cleaning & Preparation: Initial data exploration, handling missing values, and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualization of various factors such as study hours, sleep patterns, and tutoring sessions.

Key Insights: Analysis of how factors like parental involvement and income levels influence student scores.

Conclusions: Summary of the main takeaways, with a focus on practical implications for improving student outcomes.
